# **JS Essentials Showcase**

A multi-module JavaScript web application demonstrating essential front-end skills, including real-time form validation, API communication using XMLHttpRequest, and a persistent To-Do List using LocalStorage.
This project highlights core JavaScript concepts without using external libraries or frameworks.

## **Project Overview**

**JS Essentials Showcase** consists of **three independent modules**, each focusing on a key JavaScript concept:

### 1️ **Registration Form – Real-Time Validation**

A fully interactive form with dynamic validation for:

* Name
* Email
* Password + Confirm Password
* Phone number
* Date of birth (18+ check)
* Gender
* Country
* Terms agreement
* Error highlighting + disabled submit until valid
* Success message on completion

---

### 2️ **Fetch & Post API Demo**

Uses **XMLHttpRequest (XHR)** to fetch and post data:

* Fetches sample comments from JSONPlaceholder API
* Displays first 5 results with name + body
* Includes a form to create a POST request
* Shows server response dynamically

---

### 3️ **To-Do List App (LocalStorage)**

A simple, beautiful To-Do App featuring:

* Add tasks
* Delete tasks
* Auto-save tasks using LocalStorage
* Loads previous tasks on refresh
* Clean UI with gradient background
